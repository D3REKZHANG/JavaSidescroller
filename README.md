# JavaSidescroller
Simple hack-n-slash sidescroller coded with vanilla Java

<h2>Implementation Details</h2>

Written entirely in Java, using no external libraries. Code is organized in an object orientated structure, although there are some shady work arounds for some code.

Character art/spritesheet is by *ruros* and was published May, 2018.
